# AirCanvas-gesture-based-art-creation-
This project represents an innovative Air Canvas, offering a novel approach to creative
expression through hand gestures. The system translates hand motions into artistic renderings by
tracking key landmarks on the hand, particularly the knuckles. Delving into the realm of air-based
writing, a complex domain within image processing and pattern recognition, the project capitalizes
on this fascination by developing a motion-to-text converter. This transformative capability is
achieved through the integration of Computer Vision (CV), Machine Learning (ML), and the
MediaPipe library.
